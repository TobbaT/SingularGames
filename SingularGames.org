*** DONE [2024-11-18 Mon] Close enough! New game 
**** Rationale : what is behind the embedding?
The referee picks a sentence, and the players have to guess the sentence.
The referee has access to a tool that computes the difference between two sentences using an embedding model.   
When players make a guess, the referee uses the tool and informs the players of the score
Players earn points based on how much closer they are than the previous best guess.
The player reaching the threshold first gets bonus points.
**** Implementation
***** DONE Rule file
***** DONE Embedding tool 
***** DONE game loop update
**** Issues
***** TODO referee doesn't wait for tool output.
*** DONE [2024-11-16 Sat] Enable referee Requests
**** Rationale : Referee can request players to do something
Peviously referee would send messages, the messages would be queued, 
and all channels would be processed at the end of the batch.
Now, channels process their messages by default immediately. 
However, Players only queue messages, until a None message is received. 
Then the queued messages are processed and sent to the LLM.
**** Implementation
***** DONE SingularGames.py : 
- replace get_response usage
- condiionally add response on push, if not none. 
***** DONE Channel.get_response : remove unused method, now send special message instead
***** DONE Channel.push : default is to process queued
***** DONE Channel.flush : delete unused method
***** DONE Player.push : current default is to just queue, switching to only process None as last message.
***** DONE GeneralInstructions.md : update to reflec changes

*** DONE [2024-11-16 Sat] Message system overhaul
Old system :
[Channel, Message]
New system :
[[Channels], Messages...]
- Messages can be sent to multiple Channels
**** DONE  SingularGames.py : update message processing function
**** DONE  prompts/GeneralInstructions.md : update message format
**** DONE  Opther prompt files : update examples to reflect new format?
**** DONE  Improve explanation for mutli channel messages.

** General
*** TODO Review channel logic. If only players queue messages, do we need a queue in the base Channel?   
*** TODO Review : maybe all channels queued, and referee handles response logic.
*** TODO Review Player error handling. What happens to the history if the LLM request fails? 
*** TODO Fix:Makefile ??
