*** TODO [2024-11-16 Sat] Enable referee Requests
**** Rationale : Referee can request players to do something
Peviously referee would send messages, the messages would be queued, 
and all channels would be processed at the end of the batch.
Now, channels process their messages by default immediately. 
However, Players only queue messages, until a None message is received. 
Then the queued messages are processed and sent to the LLM.
**** Implementation
***** DONE SingularGames.py : 
- replace get_response usage
- condiionally add response on push, if not none. 
***** DONE Channel.get_response : remove unused method, now send special message instead
***** DONE Channel.push : default is to process queued
***** DONE Channel.flush : delete unused method
***** DONE Player.push : current default is to just queue, switching to only process None as last message.
***** TODO GeneralInstructions.py : update to reflec changes
***** TODO Review channel logic. If only players queue messages, do we need a queue in the base Channel?   
***** TODO Review Player error handling. What happens to the history if the LLM request fails? 
*** DONE [2024-11-16 Sat] Message system overhaul
Old system :
[Channel, Message]
New system :
[[Channels], Messages...]
- Messages can be sent to multiple Channels
**** DONE  SingularGames.py : update message processing function
**** DONE  prompts/GeneralInstructions.md : update message format
**** TODO  Opther prompt files : update examples to reflect new format?
**** TODO  Improve explanation for mutli channel messages.
