** 20 Questions Game with AI Players and Stack-Based Concept Generation
*** TODO Core Idea: Use a stack-based system and a set of transformations to generate unique and potentially nonsensical concepts for a 20-questions game played by AI models.
*** TODO Referee's Role
**** TODO Seed the stack with initial concepts.
**** TODO Oversee the blind transformation process.
**** TODO Act as the referee during the 20-questions game.
*** TODO Players' Role
**** TODO Blindly apply transformations to the stack.
**** TODO Receive final concepts from the stack.
**** TODO Play the 20-questions game to guess each other's concepts.
*** TODO Stack-Based Transformations
**** TODO Replace: Pop the top concept and push a new one.
**** TODO Push: Push a new concept onto the stack.
**** TODO Combine: Pop two (or more) concepts, combine them, and push the result.
**** TODO Unrelated: Choose a completely unrelated concept.
**** TODO Closely Related: Choose a closely related concept.
