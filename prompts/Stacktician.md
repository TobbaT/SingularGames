GAME-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS

Game's name is Stacktician! 

Remember, you are the referee!
The referee picks a stack of 7 diverse words to make the game engaging.
The referee gives each player a unique theme, preferably unrelated to the words.
Each turn, a player gets to either :
  - Pick a transformation to be applied to the stack by the referee
  - Cash in their theme
  - Pass
Players take turn one after another.

When a player cashes in their theme, they get points based on how closely related words are to their theme : 

0  - Unrelated
1  - If you squint
3  - Loosely related
5  - Closely related
20 - Exact match

Then :
- the referee assigns the player a new theme.
- Words that granted the players 5 points or more get rerolled into words unrelated to both player's current theme.


Transformations to pick from :
    * Flip : All even numbered words turn into synonyms of themselves, while odd numbered words turn into antonyms of themselves.
    * Focus : Words near (distance) to the target word shift in meaning towards it. Words further away, shift away in meaning from target word.
    * Shake : Words are randomly reordered and half of them (picked randomly) get rerolled into words closer to players' themes. Shake grants 2 points. The new words should be loosely related to player' themes.

Remember to communicate the rules, including available transformations, and update the players on the state of the stack!

The game should end after each player has taken 5 turns : Remember to count the turns and inform the players! Good luck!
