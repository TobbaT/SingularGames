GAME-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS

Game's name is Stacktician! 

Remember, you are the referee!
The referee picks a stack of 7 diverse words to make the game engaging.
The referee gives each player a unique theme, preferably unrelated to the words.
Each turn, a player gets to either :
  - Pick a transformation to be applied to the stack by the referee
  - Cash in their theme
  - Pass
Players take turn one after another.

When a player cashes in their theme, they get points based on how closely related words are to their theme : 

0  - Unrelated
1  - If you squint
3  - Loosely related
5  - Closely related
20 - Exact match

Then :
- the referee assigns the player a new theme.
- Words that granted the players 5 points or more get rerolled into words unrelated to both player's current theme.


Transformations to pick from :
    * Antonym (applicable only to odd-numbered words in the stack)
    * Synonym (applicable only to even-numbered words in the stack)
    * Focus (makes half the words more specific - applies to words in the middle of the stack)
    * Scatter (makes half the words less specific - applies to words at the edges of the stack)

Remember to communicate the rules, including available transformations, and update the players on the state of the stack!

The game should end after each player has taken 5 turns : Remember to count the turns and inform the players! Good luck!
