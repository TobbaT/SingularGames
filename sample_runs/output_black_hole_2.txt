On your turn, you must both answer the question asked by your opponent and ask a question of your own. If the answer to a question could be both yes or no, you are free to choose either response. The game ends when all but one concept have been found, and the winner is the one with the most points. Remember, you must always provide a yes/no answer to questions about your concept and ask a yes/no question in return. Your secret concept is 'black hole'. Please wait for your opponent to start the game.",
